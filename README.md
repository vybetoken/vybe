## Vybe Platform

Vybe is a new, modern take on decentralized finance. With multiple products that we refer to as melodies, as together they form a harmonious step forward for the industry. Our contracts were built from the ground up with upgradability in mind, which uniquely positions Vybe for flexibility in the future.

VYBE must be purchased to utilize melodies, providing intrinsic value to VYBE. You can stake your VYBE to enable the ecosystem and increase your holdings.

In the first month of Vybe's existence, 5% of the VYBE supply is issued, and 4.75% is distributed to stakers. The remaining 0.25% funds future development to ensure the platform's long-term viability. The staking rate will decrease over the next six months from the current 5% to the final staking rate of 2% of the VYBE supply.
